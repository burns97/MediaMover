# MediaMover

## Intro
Just a simple Python script I created to help learn Python.

I have multiple sources of digital images captured in my house and was looking for a way to automatically rename and move those files into a common location.

## Dependency:
This script uses a python module [PyExifTool](https://sylikc.github.io/pyexiftool/index.html) which is a wrapper for the executable Phil Harveyâ€™s [exiftool](https://exiftool.org). 

MediaMover needs to be able to locate the exiftool executable. For simplicity on Windows, I just placed a copy of it in the same directory as `MediaMover.py`. If you are running on Linux or Mac, it is probably easier to install it via your favorite package manager.

## Example
Here is an example of how to call this script:

python MediaMover.py --move -s "P:\matts_iphone" -d P:\_newformat
