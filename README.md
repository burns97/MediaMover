# MediaMover

Just a simple Python script I created to help learn Python.

I have multiple sources of digital images captured in my house and was looking for a way to automatically rename and move those files into a common location.

Here is an example of how to call this script:

python MediaMover.py --move -s "P:\matts_iphone" -d P:\_newformat
